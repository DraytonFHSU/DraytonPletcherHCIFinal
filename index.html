    <p>Hello! Welcome to the home page. I laid out each part above in the nav.</p>
    <h4>Introduction:</h4>
    <p>
        The website I had my participants review is <a href="http://usd241.org">usd241.org</a>. I selected it as I had actually 
        worked on it previously, and I had used the SOCS website designer to design it. (shown at the bottom in the footer). 
        I don't really work on it that much more nowadays, but I remembered it for this assignment and thought I'd take a 
        look at it, see how its changed, and then show other people what it looks like.
    </p>
    <p>Now, apologies for the inelegant solution to this problem, but it appears that github only allows for one page at a time.</p>

    <h1>Heuristic Evaluation</h1>
    <h3>Problem 1: Lunch menu is sideways.</h3>
    <p>Description: When loading up the lunch menu, a pdf is displayed vertically, with the information going horizontally. This makes it unreadable unless one can rotate the pdf.</p>
    <p>Location: Under lunch menu tab (findable on home page).<p>
    <p>Heuristic Violated: Consistency and Standards/Recogniton Rather than Recall</p>
    <p>Severity: 3 (Serious) </p><br>
    
    <h3>Problem 2: Spirit week not listed on school calendar.</h3>
    <p>Description: Spirit week is only found under Stuco, which is out of the way and vague.</p>
    <p>Location: School calendar<p>
    <p>Heuristic Violated: Consistency and Standards</p>
    <p>Severity: 2 (Minor)</p><br>

    <h3>Problem 3: Home page and main page are separate pages. </h3>
    <p>Description: This may cause confusion from those who see this as the same page.</p>   
    <p>Location: Home page<p>
    <p>Heuristic Violated: Visability of System Status</p>
    <p>Severity: 1 (Cosmetic)</p><br>

    <h3>Problem 4: Search Bar rarely finds anything</h3>
    <p>Description: Searching for something in the top right, such as "Spirit Week" often returns zero results.</p>
    <p>Location: Home page<p>
    <p>Heuristic Violated: Flexibility and Efficency of Use</p>
    <p>Severity: 4 (Critical)</p><br>

    <h3>Problem 5: Quicklinks section is too long and out of date</h3>
    <p>Description: Quicklinks link to documents from 2022 that need to be updated. There is also 23 different quicklinks in one box. Some of which can be removed due to redundancy.</p>
    <p>Location: Home page<p>
    <p>Heuristic Violated: Aesthetic and Minimalist design</p>
    <p>Severity: 2 (minor)</p><br>

    <h1>Personas</h1>
    <h3>Persona 1: </h3>
    <p> Name: Kathrine<br>
        <img src="../images/Katherine Stock Photo.jpg" style="height: 100px "><br>
        Demographic information: African Female, 36 years old <br>
        Job title: Small town accountant <br>
        Goals: Katherine is a humble mother who doesn't need something flashy, but would appreciate a good user experience <br>
        She would like to keep up with the local events of the school so she can be there for her daughter's games.<br>
        Environment: Medium rural house in the small town of Sharon Springs. <br>
        3 people: her, her husband, and her daughter claire<br>

        around, but not incredibly vested. Minimal phone usage <br>
        Quote: "You got this sweetie!"<br>
    </p>

    <h3>Persona 2: </h3>
    <p> Name: Holmes <br>
        <img src="../images/Holmes Stock Photo.jpg" style="height: 100px "><br>

        Job title: IT specialist <br>
        Goals: Holmes and his fiance want to leave the big city and move to a more peaceful rural town. <br> 
        He is double checking to see if the local schools are right for his family<br>
        Environment: Big, noisy city apartment <br>
        "2" people, but people can tend to walk by and interupt. Many interuptions.<br>
        Technical expertise: incredibly well versed in technology (Phone and Computer). Can work remotely and is capable to running remote sessions and checking the console for errors. <br>
        Quote: "Mhm, yes, this will do quite nicely."<br>
    </p>
    <h1>Scenarios</h1>
    <h3>Katherine Goal:</h3>
    <p>
        Kathrine is a 36 year old mother of one middle school girl. She lives in the rather small town of Sharon Springs (Population 1200). <br><br>
        
        She typically works as an accountant at the local accounting firm from 8 to 5, and she does most of the afternoon cooking around the house as well (Claire eats the school breakfasts and lunchs for mornings).
        This leads her to having some free time in the day, but time that can easily be taken away by helping with homework or calls from friends.
        She has an average technology expertise, but won't go too out of her way to find what she's looking for.<br><br>

        She tries to keep up to date on all of the events that her daughter is going to, 
        but work can get in the way somedays and it can be helpful for her to have access to the website with information on dates and times of events.
        Her daughter has a basketball game this week, and she wants to find the date and time
        for her daughter's game so that she can take time off of work to watch her daughter play. 
        She also doesn't want to make the same food that Claire eats in the morning, 
        so she'll want to double check the lunch menu as well.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Tasks 2-4 (Finding dates for events/items on lunch menu)</p>
    <h3>Holmes Goal:</h3>
    <p>
        Holmes is a 25 year old IT specialist that has been working in the big city for a couple of years.
        After many sleepless nights from the busy noises of the city, he and his fiance had decided to try to move to a smaller town.<br><br>
        
        He's able to work remotely, so location isn't too much of a concern, and he is currently considering a few different towns that may be right for them.<br><br>

        Holmes is double checking through school websites to see what the school is like in Sharon Springs.
        He wants his future kids to feel included and stable in this new possible environment.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Tasks 1 and 5 (First impressions/consistency and quality)</p>
    <h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>
    Goals:<br>
    Efficient => User can find events or documents in little to no time<br>
    Effective => User should be able to find this information<br>
    Engaging => School promotes events and necessary documents<br>
    Error Tolerant => The user should be able to trace their place in the website<br>
    Easy to Learn => User should be able to navigate the website, even with little computer experience <br>
</p>
<p>
    Scope:<br>
    3 participants. 30 minute sessions (Zoom max 40 minute meeting)<br>
</p>
<p>
    Tasks:<br>
    Task 1: Go ahead and go to the website “usd241.org”. What are your first impressions of the front page of the website? Does anything come to mind right away?
    <br>
    Task 2: Now let’s do some investigating. Where and what time is the scholar’s bowl meet  on November 25th?
    <br>
    Task 3: What are some of the items on the lunch menu for November 26th
    <br>
    Task 4: Which week is spirit week? (Don’t spend too much time looking for it. Probably no longer than 5 minutes. If you don’t find it, just put that)
    <br>
    Task 5: How is the consistency on the website? Is it easy finding your footing or do you get lost?
</p>
<p>
    Pre test Questionaire:<br>
    What's your name?<br>
    Are you okay with this being recorded?<br>
    How much time do you spend on the internet?<br>
    Do you have younger siblings going into sports<br>
    Have you ever been to the Sharon Springs high school?<br>
</p>
<h2>Moderator Script</h2>
<p>
    Hello! Thank you for joining this usability study. How are you doing today? <br><br>

    Great! Lets see here, I'd offer you refreshments, but this is online, so I can’t quite do that … <br><br>
    
    Before we begin the test, I'm going to ask you some questions. <br><br>
    First off, could I get your name? <br><br>
    
    Next, would it be okay if this is recorded? <br><br>
    
    Roughly how much time do you spend on the internet?<br><br>
    Excellent. Just a few more questions now. Did you do sports in high school?<br><br>
    Do you younger siblings going into sports?<br><br>

    Finally, have you ever been to the Sharon Springs high school?<br><br>
    
    Thank you! I’ve prepared five tasks for you to help guide you. <br><br>
    
    Task 1: Go ahead and go to the website “usd241.org”. What are your first impressions of the front page of the website? Does anything come to mind right away?<br><br>
    
    Task 2: Now let’s do some investigating for some information. Say you were looking to go to  an upcoming Christmas concert. Where and what time would that be?<br><br>
    
    Task 3: What are some of the items on the lunch menu for December 5th?<br><br>
    
    Task 4: Which week is spirit week? (This one’s a little bit rough, so don’t spend too much time looking for it. Probably no longer than 5 minutes. If you don’t find it, just put that)<br><br>
    
    Task 5: How is the consistency on the website? Is it easy finding your footing or do you get lost? <br><br>
    
    Additional Notes:<br><br>
    
    Thank you for  participating in this Usability Study! Hope you have a good day!<br><br>

<h1>Tests</h1>
    <h4>Matthew Herrick</h4>
    <p>Pretty experienced with technology/internet (12 hours). Had not participated in sports or been to Sharon Springs High School.</p>
    <p>Also, apologies, I was figuring out the zoom meeting settings, so not much happens until (5:09) </p>

    </iframe> 
    <h1>Results</h1>
    <h4>Matthew</h4>
    <p>(7:57)Struck by blue color scheme. First impressions say "it's a perfectly servicible website". Mentioned it was missing some bells and whistles.</p>
    <p>(10:25)Was able to find the calendar and lunch menu quickly, but was surprised by the rotated lunch menu and felt not everyone would find that.</p>
    <p>(11:15-21:15)Matthew spent a sizeable amount of time looking for spirit week, but it's so out of the way that he was unable to find it without a couple nudges. Quicklinks was hidden.</p>
    <p>(17:54)Pretty barebones, which makes it easy to find ones way around. </p>
    <p>(18:50)Noted varying picture quality/ picture repetition. </p>

    <h4>Alicia</h4>
    <p>(3:53) Nav should be centered. Pictures again. </p>
    <p>(5:53) Mentioned wanting a search bar. Provided on not distincive enough. </p>
    <p>(6:30)Lunch Menu rotation again. </p>
    <p>(8:10)Main page confusion and picture too big.</p>
    <p>(11:52) Inconsistent quicklink size/quicklink issues.</p>
    <p>(14:40) Daily announcements downloaded to the computer.</p>
    <p>(16:20) Archive issues: Search feature overcomplicated, and months are arranged very strangely.</p>
    <p>(17:10) links take user to top of page every time.</p> 
    <p>(18:25) Search troubles, error message not near search bar.</p> 
    <p>(19:45) Redundant filter in directory. organized by title. Pictures redundant.</p>
    <p>(21:20) Nothing on contact us.</p> 
    <p>(21:40) Dates associated with resources and download issue again.</p>
    <p>(22:40) More out of date articles.</p>
    <p>(22:55) Lack of information on counselor page/redundancy/badly designed counselor page.</p>

    <h4>Illay</h4>
    <p>(5:20) Initial impression is the website is streamlined. Nav looks good.</p>
    <p>(7:50) Issues with the links taking to the top again. Additionally, Illay suggested for a confirm option for changing the date. </p>
    <p>(10:15) Lunch menu issues once more. (11:52) suggested option to choose month of lunch menu.</p>
    <p>(14:40) Start to spirit week.</p>
    <p>(15:22) Changed category. maybe not obvious all are presented as default.</p>
    <p>(19:14) looked in weekly bulletin.</p>
    <p>(20:20) Illay gives up on finding spirit week. </p>
    <p>Consistency good, but (24:20) in depth sections are kind of lacking and overly complicated.</p>
    <p>(27:45) Adding a little bit of differences between tabs could help the website.</p>
    <p>(30:20) Might be cluttered for phone usage.</p>
    <p>(31:55) No autocorrect/couldn't find spirit week in search bar.</p>

    <h4>Other Notes:</h4>
    <p>Multiple options for users on the calendar proved rather useful.</p>
    <p>One incredibly difficult part for the users was the spirit week location. Alicia, who was a part of the student council at her school, quickly found it under the Stuco quicklink.<br>
    Unfortunately, the other two users struggled to find spirit week's location, one giving up at the calendar.</p>
    <p>The poor picture quality stood out to the users and the size tended to make them more annoyed.</p>
    <h1>Recommendations</h1>
    <ul>
    <li>Updates: The designers should probably keep the website up to date. There are several places mentioning documents pertaining to 2022, etc. that take up space without being needed.</li>
    <li>Main Picture Banner: The picture banner seems to distract on nearly every page. It goes entirely through to the fold, blocking information.</li>
    <li>Picture quality: Additionally some of the photos were really blurry and took away from the experience.</li>
    <li>Link reset: The designers could also find a way to make it so that clicking on a new page doesn't send the user to the top, requiring them to scroll down. </li>
    <li>Lunch Menu: The lunch menu could stand to be either incorporated like the normal calendar, or at the very least, rotated so that it can be read without adjustment.</li>
    <li>Search Bar: The search bar could do a lot more in helping people find information around the website.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Self Reflection</h1>
    <p>I was slightly confused in the beginning of the assignment, as the website turn-in link was hidden under the testing folder. I saw the participation assignment being front and center but missed the website turn-in for a bit.</p>

    <p>I think I started getting a little burnt out near the end.</p>

    <p>One thing I found was that it was kind of stressful for me when I was the overseer rather than then the participant, but ...</p>

    <p>I definitely seemed a lot more comfortable starting the second session though.</p>

    <p>Lastly, I would have like a recommendation or a link to the hosting server we could use so that we don't have to fiddle around with ones that might not work.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Thanks for taking a look at my report! Hope you have a great winter break!</p>
